//--------------------------------View Components
View Component is a combination of a class (derived from ViewComponent) that supplied data, and a partial view to render that data.
Things to create the project: 
1. .NET Project
2. Get the things ready in program.cs
3. Create wwwroot and add the css file
4. create the controller folder and the home controller (don't forget create a folder for the controller ex Home) and add routing and give the naming to each controller
5. Create the view folder and and generate the views for each controller
6. create Shared folder and Layout for the views
7. Create _ViewStart to import the layout in all the project

//The Goal of this lecture is to have content in both views shared: 
Partial Views will be good, but this lesson it will be different: 
VIEW COMPONENT
1. create a folder for view Components and add a class
2. Must inherit from ViewComponent
//----------------------------------view Components 2
3. Create the path Views/Shared/Components/Grid/Default.cshtml (If I want to give a different name other than default, I have to make it explicit to the controller)
4. in the index view we invoke the component
5. We added the component view as well in about view -- This can be done as well with a tag helper
6. We created a new file in view ViewIMports -> we imported the taghelpers here
7. then we created th <vc> tag helper in about everything in vc must be lower case
//----------------------------------View Components with View Data
ViewComponent class can share View Data object to the ViewComponent view
1. We create the model classes, folder and class
2. create another model class that is gridpersons
3. import the models namespace in the grid componnet
4. create the grid of persons in order to be sent to the view data object to the partial view
5. save the model data in a viewData[], then retrieved as a viewBag in the Default view.
6. I have to import the person model in the View imports
//----------------------------------Strongly typed view components
Strongly Typed ViewComponent's view is a tightly bound to a specified model class. So, it gets all the benefits of a strongly typed view.
1. Instead of passing the view data, then we will pass the same as a model object
2. we passed to the view the personGridModal object in GridViewComponents
3. add import in Default of the model
4. Now instead of using viewBag we use Model
****This is useful to use when there is a specific model object to supply to the partial view, then it will be easier to access properies without typecast. However , when wnting to pass loose data like string values or numbers the viewdata or view bag are better
//----------------------------------ViewComponents with parameters
you can supply one or more parameters to the view components class. The parameters are received by InvokeAsync method of the view component class.
All the parameters of view component are mandatory (must supply a value)
****PArent View
@awaitComponent.InvokeAsync("view component name", new {param1=value1, param2 = value, ...});
****View Component class
InvokeAsync(datatype param1, datatype param2,..) {}
---A good use is for example in a component, like a table if I want to provide different names every time or different values this will be the way to do it.
1. add parameters in index
2. receive it in gridview components
3. Another model was supplied in the about, the reason behaind is that this needs to be invoked as many times is defined because it might cause a null exception
//----------------------------------View Components Result
ViewComponent can repreent the content of a view component.
Generally useful to fetch view component's content into the browser, by making an asynchronous request (XMLHttpRequest / fetch request) from the browser.
The Idea of this is have content in demand, so when a user clicks on a button then the view will be generated by javascript.
1. Create new action method in the home controller
2. transfer the model persongridmodel to the home controller
3. add js script
